                    <p>My name is Gali Price, I live in Singapore since 2015 and I love fitness.
                        <br><br>
                        I started my professional life as a Registered Nurse, then made a career change to working as a lawyer. After graduating from Law and Business School I've decided to combine my medical knowledge with my new profession and started working as a Body
                        Damages Lawyer, with special focus on body damages caused by diseases and different accidents, including sport accidents and injuries- and their effect on functionality.
                        <br><br>
                        During my years of practice I've obtained a comprehensive knowledge about the human body and the function of its different systems.
                        <br><br>
                        I've been doing sport for most of my life, started as a competitive athlete as a child, and continued exercising different types of sports along the way up until now.
                        <br><br>
                        During the years I've been training and helping friends and acquaintances just for fun.
                        <br><br>
                        After moving to Singapore, I've decided to establish my passion for sport into a profession, and got my professional qualifications:
                        <br>
                        <ul>
                            <li>ACE (American Council on Exercise) CERTIFIED PPERSONAL TRAINER certification.</li>
                            <li>International Sport Academy (ISA Singapore) PERSONAL TRAINER certification.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <br>
                        The studies covered a comprehensive range of topics such as: Anatomy, Physiology, Kinesiology, Nutrition, Physiology of Training, Behavioral Change and Health Psychology, Principles of Motivation and Adherence, Exercise Programming for athletes at
                        all levels start from Sedentary individuals, Injury Prevention and Emergency Procedures and Exercise for Special Populations With special needs and health concerns.

                    <p>What is TRX?
                        <br>
                        TRX -Total Body Resistance Exercises, refers to a specialized form of suspension training system that utilizes equipment made of of two straps, developed by a former U.S. Navy Seal to stay in top shape anywhere.
                        <br>
                        The straps can be hung anywhere, indoors or out, at the local park, home, office, hotel room etc.
                        <br><br>
                        TRX workout includes combining aerobic and anaerobic training in many enjoyable different exercises.
                        <br>
                        During workout, you can control the level of challenge by simply adjusting your body position (step backward or forward) to increase or decrease resistance.
                        <br><br>
                        TRX trainings are fun, developing your strength, balance, flexibility and core stability simultaneously, and are also great for conditioning.
                        <br>
                        There are endless different exercises that you can choose for your TRX training so it's never boring and always challenging.
                        <br>
                        TRX training saves time and enables maximal work in minimum time- that's due to the nature of TRX exercise - using all in 1 system.
                        <br><br>
                        It is highly recommended to perform the first trainings with a personal trainer that will guide you on the right use of the TRX for a proper and safe exercise.
                        <br><br>
                        In my sessions you will be able to choose a full TRX session or combining it as a part of an integrated workout.

                    <p>Running is a basic and available activity to everyone, all you need is a pair of sneakers and a decision.
                        <br><br>
                        The running world is a wonderful world, you have probably noticed recently that more and more people are running. The reason is, that on top of the health benefits related to running- right from the first day of running – physiological changes occur
                        in the body and create a marvelous sensation- physical and mental.
                        <br><br>
                        <strong>Why isn’t everyone running?</strong>
                        The reason is that the first stage of deciding and starting to run is the most difficult, and without professional guidance might discourage and lead to injury.
                        <br>
                        With the support of a personal trainer you will be able to enjoy the first most difficult stage of getting into the running world.

                        Running has so many benefits:
                        <br><br>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Did you know that running is "Anti Aging"? Scientific research shows that intense physical activity such as running, even among amateur exercisers, prolongs life expectancy by as much as an average of 5 years. The reason is that physical activity
                                significantly prevents many different diseases and health conditions: cardiovascular, metabolic diseases like diabetes, and some kinds of cancer.</li>
                            <li>Running as a weight-bearing exercise preserves bone and muscle mass in the body and is excellent for prevention and treatment for osteoporosis (low bone mass). Running also increases growth hormone levels and described by some as the key to
                                slowing the aging process.</li>

                            <li>Running reduces anxiety, relieves stress, decreases depression levels and fatigue, and high intensity running eliminates aggression. Running clears your mind, and during running you will often get to solve problems that during daytime bothered
                                you and appeared non-solvable.</li>
                            <li>During running, the body releases chemicals called Endorphines, that trigger a positive feeling in the body similar to drugs - which leads to a euphoric sensation, known as "Runners High".</li>
                            <li>Running regularly trains the consciousness and enables you to strengthen your determination and to overcome obstacles, within your exercise program as well as in your personal life.</li>
